- When a download’s price has been lowered, automatically notify users that have the download in their list. Either notify through email (opt in) or show visually on the list.
- Notify/remind the customer after X amount of time to rekindle interest with the items in their wish list.
- Notify customer on their wish list pages when they are about to expire. Prompt them to register to store their list indefinitely
- Allow customers to sort their lists by price/alphabetically etc
- Provide option for Shop Manager so they can limit the amount of lists a customer can make.
- Email customer when item is nearly sold out (for when a plugin is used to control stock)
- Option for users to set their list to “gift registry” mode. Doing so will let anyone viewing their list know that the items on this list are for Person X. When a purchase is made, the item is removed from the gift registry (or marked as purchased) and the product is email directly to Person X. When in this mode, the user sharing the list must provide their first name, last name (optional) and email address
- Allow customer to add notes against a product. This looks like it’s quite popular.
- Allow customer to move and/or copy items from one list to another
