* Fix: Cart quantities in some themes were being updated when a download was added to a wish list.
* Fix: When EDD was deactivated and reactivated the wish list page was not viewable until either the EDD settings were saved or Wish Lists was deactivated and reactivated.

* Tweak: New activation class
* Tweak: Changed the "edit" and "view" query vars to "wl_edit" and "wl_view". This was to avoid potential conflicts with other plugins using the same names.
