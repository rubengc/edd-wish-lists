= Version 1.0.9, February 10th, 2015 =
* Fix: Cart quantities in some themes were being updated when a download was added to a wish list.
* Fix: When EDD was deactivated and reactivated the wish list page was not viewable until either the EDD settings were saved or Wish Lists was deactivated and reactivated.
* Tweak: Leaving "Enable Ajax" unchecked in downloads -> settings -> misc no longer affects Wish Lists. Ajax is always required for Wish Lists so now works regardless of this setting.

* Tweak: Removed html { overflow-y: inherit; } CSS rule
* Tweak: New activation class
* Tweak: Changed the "edit" and "view" query vars to "wl_edit" and "wl_view". This was to avoid potential conflicts with other plugins using the same names.
